# manjaro-essentials
A quick shell script that lets you install important packages for the manjaro minimal install - it's mostly for personal use but I hope others find it useful!

I've had to reinstall manjaro multiple times over the last few days, due to things going wrong, windows messing up installs, etc - and I have found myself having to type in the same series of commands, and it has been a nightmare.  Luckily this is no more - as I have finally got around to writing a script that installs all of the important packages that I use on a daily basis, quickly.

You are, needless to say, more than welcome to fork this project and change around some of the installed packages for your own purposes.
